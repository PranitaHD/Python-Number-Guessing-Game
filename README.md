# Python-Number-Guessing-Game
Language :- Python Programming. It is a program in Python which generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program will display a message "Lower Number Please".  Similarly if the player's guess is lesser than the actual number, the program will display a message "Higher Number Please". When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of attempts to arrive at the number. You have 10 attempts to guess the random number. Some emoji's are also used in the final result. I have used Visual Studio Code here.
